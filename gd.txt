MVP

1) The bird starts moving on page load. It constantly moves from left to right while gradually losing heigth.
Unmoving obstacles in the form of vertical columns from up, down or both appear and move/stay with
the world. If the bird touches ceil, floor or columns the game is restarted.
The player should avoid the obstacles using the only control he has - Space button. Pressing Space gives
the bird a surge up.

2) A counter shows the number of seconds since the start of the game.

3) Starting screen with the best and the last result and a button Start should appear after page load
or game finish.

4) Fine tune the space up force to achieve desirable level of difficulty. The bird should be easy
to control but the obstacles are hard to avoid.
